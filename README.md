This is simple program that will help you in your Air Traffic Control services in VATSIM. The flexibility of this utility allows any ARTCC to configure and use  this software as they see fit. More information about this is provided on the Wiki page.

 The idea of this program is to increase simplicity and decrease memorization required when it comes to complex LOAs and SOPs. a

## Features

#### Main Features
- **Customizable** -- One of the biggest goals of this program is to create a customizable app which can be adjusted to be most practical for any for any given VATSIM controller. All customization options can be found in the Settings Page. 

- **Basic Information Display (BID)** -- Provides information that will be useful to all controllers. Things like Aircraft Type Designators, Airline Names, and others are included. 

- **Flight Plan Analyzer** -- This program has the ability to check and validate flight plans and correct it as appropriate in accordance with the LOAs and SOPs set. More info concerning this can be found on the Wiki. 

- **File Editors** -- This will provide an easy and clean environment for editing complex and previously un-editable alias and POF files. More info about this can be found on the wiki. 

- **Track Calling** -- Never miss a callsign! This will be in the form of a small window that can be placed anywhere on your screen. It will popup with the current callsign that is currently talking. (Couldn't think of any other name to call this feature.) 

- **Open Source** -- Not really a feature, but this was another one of those things that I wanted to make sure happens. A major reason is because my programming skills are by no means good, therefore having it open-source will allow other developers to implement their own features.

#### Planned Features 
- **Automatic TEC Route Update** 
- **Centralized Portal** -- The idea here is to be able to provide a website in which will be used to have User upload LOAs and SOPs. This will be particulary useful for an ARTCC's Facility Engineer, since they'll be able to distribute updates to each people in their Roster.
	- User Authorization System - Simple idea, it's going to provide data that will be very useful for what has been mentioned above.
- ... and many more!
