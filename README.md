This is simple program that will help you in your Air Traffic Control services in Vatsim. It is customizable to be used by any ARTCC, with very clear instructions on how to edit them as appropriate. This is provided in the Wiki page.

The idea of this program is to provide less things that you need to memorize, and more things that you need repetition of. Quite simple since repetition provides better experience than memorizing an entire directory worth of SOPs and LOAs.

## Features

#### Main Features
- **Customizable** -- One of the biggest goal of this program was to build a customizable app where it can be tuned to be useful for all Vatsim Controllers. All customization options can be found in the Settings Page.

- **Basic Information Display (BID)** -- Provides information that will be useful to all controllers. Things like Aircraft Type Designators, Airline Names, etc.

- **Flight Plan Analyzer** -- This program has the ability to check for flight plans and correct it as appropriate in accordance with the LOAs and SOPs set. More info about this on the Wiki.

- **File Editors** -- The things that will be edited are things like POF and Alias files. This will provide a clean and easy environment for editing such large and difficult to read files. More info about this on the Wiki.

- **Track Calling** -- Never miss a callsign! This will be in the form of a small window that can be placed anywhere on your screen, it will popup with the current callsign that's talking or talked. (Couldn't think of any other name to call this feature.)

- **Open Source** -- Not really a feature, but this was another one of those things which I wanted to make sure it happens. Major reason is because my programming skill is by no means good, hence having it open-source will allow for other developers to implement features they want.

#### Planned Features
- **Automatic TEC Route Update**
- **Centralized Portal** -- The idea here is to be able to provide a website in which will be used to have User upload LOAs and SOPs. This will be particulary useful for an ARTCC's Facility Engineer, since they'll be able to distribute updates to each people in their Roster.
	- User Authorization System - Simple idea, it's going to provide data that will be very useful for what has been mentioned above.
- ... and many more!
